# Hoomd-Blue code to run a polymer simulation
  1. BulkPolymer contains the code to run a homo polymer chain in bulk. --> <br>
    (a. chain3d.py to create a linear chain conformation to start with. <br> 
     b. Poly3d.py to run the simulation in NVT ensemble. <br> 
     c. config_analysis.py to do some statistical analysis on the output trajectoty data using MDAnalysis module.
    )
  2. To get a basis overview on how to run, please see the HOOMD-README.pdf.
